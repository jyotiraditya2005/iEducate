            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like
                public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling
                system, while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and
                non-formal education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education,
                secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language
                education
                , and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of
                educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

                constitution for the state in October 1951, after an election in which all the seats were won by the
                Jammu & Kashmir National Conference party of Abdullah.[11]

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948, the princely state of Jammu
                and Kashmir was divided between India (which controlled the regions of Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and
                Ladakh) and Pakistan (which controlled Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir).[8] Maharaja Hari Singh signed
                the Instrument of Accession on 26 October 1947 after an invasion by Pakistani tribesmen. Sheikh Abdullah
                was appointed as the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir as part of an interim government by Maharaja
                Hari Singh in March 1948.[9] In order to integrate the provisions of the instrument of accession
                relating to the powers of the state and Indian government, the Constituent Assembly of India drew up the
                draft provision named Article 306-A, which would later become Article 370.[10]
